// Make your global todos array here.
// Put a few todos in there to start with!
// This is mostly to give us some data to test our functions with.


// Now test it here just by console.logging a particular todo index.


// Next: a function that prints a todo.
// For now, just have this function console log the value passed in!
// (We'll expand this helper later.)



// Below, call your printTodo with a value of any kind. All it will do is console.log it,
// but soon we'll do more with it!

// Now write a function that prints everything on our todo list, INDIVIDUALLY.
// Make SURE to use the above printTodo function!


//Now test it out by calling your print-everything function. It should print out each item from your todo list array.


// Now please write a function that adds an item to our todo list.
// Could add it anywhere! We'll talk about where it should be added eventually.


// Test the above function by calling it with a value,
// then calling your print-everything function and making sure it's in there.


// Now write a function that removes an item at a given index from our todo list.


// Test the above function by passing it an index, then calling our print-everything
// function to see if the correct thing was removed.


// Lastly: write a function that clears all items from our array.


// Test it by calling it and then calling your print-everything function.
// Nothing should print because the array should be empty now!
